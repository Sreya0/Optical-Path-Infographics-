We assumed that B is a parent node for the set (B, C, D).

We preserve a single representative for each node in the disjoint collection.

When we look for an element in a specific node, it takes us to the parent of
that node.

We now have two subsets, but neither B nor A has a parent node.

Each tree is an independent disjoint set, which means that if two or more
items are in the same tree, they belong to the same disjoint set, otherwise
they are separate.

If B is a representation for a certain tree, then Parent[i]=B.

If B is not a representative, we can move up the tree to find the parent or
representative for the tree
